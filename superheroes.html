				<p> I am a huge fan of Marvel and DC content, have been reading comics since I was a child and then really liked the MCU content and have been hooked since then. I keep up with all the latest fan theories and watch the tv episodes and movies as soon as possible. Favorite superhero is Iron Man and Green Arrow. </p>

					<dd> Comic Book Publishing company that created the MCU, X-Men, Fantastic Four, Spider-Man(don't forget the hyphen), and many other popular superhero characters. It's movies are characterized by a jovial and joking tone compared to DC's more solemn and serious tone. </dd>

					<dd> DC, also known as Detective Comics, created characters like The Batman, Superman, Supergirl, Wonder Woman, The Flash, and many other household superheroes. While Marvel dominates in the movie medium with the MCU, DC sees more success in most other fields such as video games, comic book sales, animated tv shows and movies.
