				<p> I have been really interested in Boxing ever since I saw Creed 2. I was flying to meet family and they had the movie on the plane and it was amazing. I have been boxing since then for the last three years, but I don't really want to compete. Even though Creed 2 is my favorite movie, I have never seen Creed 1. There are four main types of boxing styles that are acceptable to use. </p>

					<dt> <a href="https://www.legendsboxing.com/post/what-are-the-4-styles-of-boxing"> <b> The Swarmer </b> </a></dt>
					<dd> This style is where you bombard your opponents with attacks, constantly forcing them to be on the defensive and blocking instead of trying to get some punches on you. It's quite difficult because it needs lots of stamina. </dd>
					<dt> <a href="https://www.legendsboxing.com/post/what-are-the-4-styles-of-boxing"> <b> The Slugger </b> </a></dt>
					<dd> This style focuses on punching very rarely, but using lots of power when actually throwing a punch. The goal is to knock the opponent out within one punch itself. This style requires very strong defensive skills because they will have to make up their lack of offense with lots of defense. </dd>
					<dt><a href="https://www.legendsboxing.com/post/what-are-the-4-styles-of-boxing"> <b> The Out-Boxer </b></a></dt>
					<dd> This style is all about strategy, it requires staying a distance away and choosing to come in with a combo at the perfect time and waiting until it's time to strike. </dd>
					<dt> <a href="https://www.legendsboxing.com/post/what-are-the-4-styles-of-boxing"> <b> The Boxer-Puncher </b></a></dt>
					<dd> This style essentially combines the Out-Boxer and the Slugger. The dangerous part about this style is that since distance has to be maintained, if a large punch is attempted and the opponent sees it coming, the opponent can respond with a deadly blow easily.  </dd>
