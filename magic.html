				<p> Card tricks and magic have interested me since I was roughly five years old. I would learn dozens of tricks and perform them at events, I created my own playing card decks, and I collect card decks now as well. My love for magic also came from a movie, Harry Potter. The first movie was so magical and inspiring and the love for magic just spiraled from there. </p>

					<dd> Cardistry is composed of flourishes, spreads, tosses, catches, and many other advanced card manipulation techniques that are designed to be used in conjunction with card tricks to bring more awe and distract the audience or performed solo as a performance. </dd>
